<span style="font-size: smaller;">
A.

B. A common example involves the batting averages of players in professional baseball. It is possible for one player to have a higher batting average than another player each year for a number of years, but to have a lower batting average across all of those years. This phenomenon can occur when there are large differences in the number of at bats between the years.

<span style="font-size: smaller;">
C. Over half of the car accidents reported in 2002 happened within 8kms from the driver’s home. Therefore, we tend to overinflate the sense of danger when close to home. In fact, the reason most crashes occur close to home is because we spend most of our time driving near our house. At any one time, we’re no more likely to crash just because we’re near home.
